# LiveTradesPage Performance Optimizations

## Problem
The LiveTradesPage table was blinking and shaking during frequent updates because:
- The entire table was re-rendering on every trade update
- Unstable React keys were causing unnecessary re-renders
- Layout shifts were occurring due to variable content lengths

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. React.memo Components
- **TradeRow**: Memoized individual trade rows to prevent re-renders when props haven't changed
- **TradesTable**: Memoized the entire table component
- **TradesSummary**: Memoized the summary section

### 2. Stable Keys
- Changed from index-based keys to stable keys using: `${trade.symbol}-${trade.tradeId}-${trade.receivedAt}`
- Added `receivedAt` timestamp to ensure uniqueness
- This prevents React from re-rendering existing rows unnecessarily

### 3. CSS Optimizations
- **Fixed Table Layout**: Added `table-layout: fixed` for stable column widths
- **Column Width Specifications**: Defined specific widths for each column (15%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 25%)
- **Text Overflow**: Added `white-space: nowrap` and `text-overflow: ellipsis` to prevent layout shifts
- **Smooth Transitions**: Reduced animation duration from 0.3s to 0.2s for faster updates
- **CSS Containment**: Added `contain: layout style paint` to isolate rendering

### 4. Performance Improvements
- **useCallback**: Memoized formatting functions to prevent recreation on every render
- **useMemo**: Memoized summary calculations to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Functional Updates**: Used functional state updates to ensure we're working with the latest state

### 5. Visual Improvements
- **Reduced Animation Distance**: Changed from 10px to 5px translation for smoother animations
- **Color Transitions**: Added smooth color transitions for price changes
- **Layout Stability**: Prevented layout shifts during updates

## Results
- ✅ No more table blinking or shaking
- ✅ Only updated cells re-render
- ✅ Smooth visual transitions
- ✅ Stable layout during frequent updates
- ✅ Better performance with high-frequency trade data

## Technical Details
- **React.memo**: Prevents re-renders when props are shallowly equal
- **Stable Keys**: Ensures React can properly track and update only changed elements
- **CSS Containment**: Isolates rendering to prevent layout thrashing
- **Fixed Table Layout**: Provides predictable column widths
